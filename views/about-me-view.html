				<h3>About me</h3>
				<div class='half-p'>
					<p>My name is Matthew Ross, and welcome to my web portfolio.</p>
					<p>I am a Javascript developer who is passionate about my profession. The maturation of Javascript into a well rounded MVC framework, server, and database excites me. The simplicity of creating rich and fast web applications stirs my creativitiy.</p>
					<p>After graduating from the <em>University of Washington</em> in 2011, I spent a little over a year working at a start-up web company, named <em>Priveazy</em>.</p>

				<div class='half-p'>
					<p>Once I left Priveazy, I worked at my parents HVAC (heating and cooling) company as a service technician (amoung many things). During this time I worked on several large web applications, inspired by demand in the industry.</p>
					<p>Last December I completed the <em>Code Fellows Javascript Boot Camp</em> which earned me a fuller understanding of the language, and introduced me to some new tools, such as Grunt</p>
